# voko-iloj

All the software tools to create Reta Vortaro http://reta-voratro.de - a multilingual dictionary with Esperanto definitions.

The software can by used for other dictionaries and terminlogies as well.

Articles defining words are written in XML based on a DTD (voko.dtd) 
and translated by XSL transformations to HTML including various indexes. 

Ant scripts provide the framwork for all the necesary transformations to compile a full web dictionary from the XML articles.
